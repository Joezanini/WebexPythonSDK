**webexpythonsdk** v1.7 will be the last ðŸ¤ž release of the `webexpythonsdk` package. This will be the last release
supporting Python v2 and v3 compatibility; it is compatible Python v3 releases *up to Python v3.10*.

Going forward, the `webexpythonsdk` package will be replaced by the `WebexPythonSDK` package, which will support Python
v3.10+.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


**webexpythonsdk** is a *community developed* Python library for working with the Webex APIs.  Our goal is to make
working with Webex in Python a *native* and *natural* experience!

.. code-block:: Python

    from webexpythonsdk import WebexAPI

    api = WebexAPI()

    # Find all rooms that have 'webexpythonsdk Demo' in their title
    all_rooms = api.rooms.list()
    demo_rooms = [room for room in all_rooms if 'webexpythonsdk Demo' in room.title]

    # Delete all of the demo rooms
    for room in demo_rooms:
        api.rooms.delete(room.id)

    # Create a new demo room
    demo_room = api.rooms.create('webexpythonsdk Demo')

    # Add people to the new demo room
    email_addresses = ["test01@cmlccie.com", "test02@cmlccie.com"]
    for email in email_addresses:
        api.memberships.create(demo_room.id, personEmail=email)

    # Post a message to the new room, and upload a file
    api.messages.create(demo_room.id, text="Welcome to the room!",
                        files=["https://www.webex.com/content/dam/wbx/us/images/navigation/CiscoWebex-Logo_white.png"])


That's more than 6 Webex API calls in less than 23 lines of code (with comments and whitespace), and likely more
than that, since webexpythonsdk handles pagination_ for you automatically!

webexpythonsdk makes your life better...  `Learn how!`__

__ Introduction_


Features
--------

webexpythonsdk does all of this for you:

* Transparently sources your Webex access token from your local environment

* Provides and uses default arguments and settings everywhere possible, so you don't have to think about things like API
  endpoint URLs, HTTP headers and JSON formats

* Represents all Webex API interactions using native Python tools

  * Authentication and Connection to the Webex Cloud ==> **WebexAPI** "connection object"

  * API Calls ==> Hierarchically organized methods underneath the **WebexAPI** 'Connection Object'

  * Returned Data Objects ==> Native Python objects

* **Automatic and transparent pagination!**

* **Automatic rate-limit handling!** *(wait|retry)*

* Multipart encoding and uploading of local files

* Auto-completion in your favorite IDE, descriptive exceptions, and so much more...

History
-------

The Webex Python SDK (webexpythonsdk) library started as Cisco Spark API (ciscosparkapi). We updated the library's name in
alignment with Cisco's re-brand of Cisco Spark to Webex. The Cisco Spark API library has been deprecated and is no
longer supported; however, its open-source codebase is still available in the `ciscosparkapi`_ branch of this
repository.

The development team may make additional name changes as the library evolves with the Webex APIs published on
developer.webex.com.
